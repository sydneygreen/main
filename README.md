### PROBLEM STATEMENT: Predict the energy consumption of buildings based on historical data. 

### DATA: 

Historical Consumption: A selected time series of consumption data for over 200 buildings

Building Metadata: Information Including Site number of building, surface area of building, temperatures of the building, and data on if the building is open or closed.

Public Holidays Data: Includes name and dates of holidays for each site ID.

Historical Weather Data: Information on the temperature of the weather station and the timestamp of measurement. 


### Methodology:

1. Create visualizations of data
2. Correlation Matrix
3. Feature Importance
4. Build Models
5. Evaluate Models
6. Build applications for users
